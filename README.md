### Welcome!!! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Tim.  I'm an experienced Web Engineer focused on Front End Development with a demonstrated history of working in the marketing/advertising, and entertainment industries. 

Predominately I work with Javascript, React, Node, and Sass, and have created award winning web experiences. I also focus on UX, accessibility, and design. 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently improving my skills with Astro, Vue, and TypeScript. 

ðŸ“ƒ I recently earned an AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner badge and am studying to pass the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate certification. I am becoming more interested in architecture and devops.

I'm always open to collaborations and just talking about code so feel free to contact me!
